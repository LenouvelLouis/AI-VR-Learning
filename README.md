# 🎓 EduVerse — AI & VR Educational Experience

## 🧠 Purpose of the Project
Our project is an innovative educational application for the **Meta Quest 3S** virtual reality headset.  
It combines **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Virtual Reality (VR)** to make learning more immersive and interactive.

The AI can recognize objects in real time and provide users with educational information about them — such as their **history** or **cultural background**.  
This turns a simple VR experience into a **fun and engaging way to learn**, useful for schools in the future.
